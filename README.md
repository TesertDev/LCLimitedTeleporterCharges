# Limited Teleporter Charges
#### Introduces a finite number of charges for the teleporter, in contrast to vanilla where the teleporter has unlimited charges.

## Features
* Limited amount of charges for the regular teleporter. Every use of the teleporter will consume a charge.
* [Tooltip](https://i.imgur.com/9HumfTP.png) to show how many charges are left when looking at the button.
* Disabling the button when the teleporter is out of charges.
* Charges reset every in-game day.
* The amount of charges is configurable via the config file.
* Charges are synced with other players depending on the hosts config setting. 
* Charges are synced with other players even when joining the game late (works with [LateCompany](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/anormaltwig/LateCompany/)).

## Motivation for mod
I felt like the unlimited teleporter uses diminished the game's tension. Death isn't very punishing when you know that you won't be costing your team credits, as long as you die without your corpse being destroyed, as your body can be teleported out without downside. In addition to that, there's also little to no downside to running into the dungeon with no equipment, dying, and then getting your corpse teleported.

With this mod, your ship's operator must now carefully consider when to use teleporter charges and when to reserve them for more critical moments. Additionally, you'll most likely find yourself needing to carry out at least some of your friends' corpses by yourself. The desired side effect of this small change, should be that dying in general is going to be more consequencial.

Currently not planning to add charges for the inverse teleporter. Could change if people show interest.
